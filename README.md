# Crop_production

In this model, I have utilized the Decision Tree algorithm to predict crop production in different states and cities of India. The model takes several features into consideration and predicts whether crop production will occur or not. With a deployment accuracy of 96%, our model demonstrates strong performance. This predictive model can provide valuable insights into crop production patterns and aid in decision-making processes related to agriculture.
